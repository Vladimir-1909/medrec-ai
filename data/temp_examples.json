Normal fasting glucose level suggests absence of carbohydrate metabolism disorders at present. Normal kidney and liver function markers indicate adequate organ function.",
      "block_2_abnormalities": "Decreased hemoglobin to 9.8 g/dL with simultaneously low serum iron (7.2 µmol/L) and ferritin (18 ng/mL) corresponds to iron deficiency anemia. Elevated transferrin and total iron binding capacity confirm depletion of iron stores. The most probable cause in this case is heavy menstrual blood loss described in the history. Ferritin below 30 ng/mL confirms iron deficiency even without pronounced anemia. Additional contributing factors may include insufficient dietary iron intake or impaired absorption.",
      "block_3_symptom_correlation": "Fatigue and shortness of breath with physical exertion are typical manifestations of anemia, resulting from reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of blood. Brittle nails frequently occur with chronic iron deficiency and may persist even after hemoglobin normalization. Symptoms correlate with identified laboratory abnormalities and form a clinical picture characteristic of iron deficiency state.",
      "block_4_additional_tests": "For clarification of iron deficiency cause, measurement of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and sTfR/log ferritin ratio may be useful. In case of persistent anemia after 3 months of iron therapy, gastroenterology consultation and upper endoscopy may be considered to exclude occult gastrointestinal bleeding. Preparation for endoscopic procedures is determined individually by the treating physician. Repeat blood tests (complete blood count, ferritin, serum iron) may be appropriate after 4 weeks of therapy to assess dynamics.",
      "block_5_specialist_consultations": "Given heavy menstrual bleeding, gynecology consultation may be appropriate to evaluate need for menstrual cycle regulation. If anemia persists after 3 months of adequate iron therapy, hematology consultation may be considered to exclude other anemia causes. In case of gastrointestinal bleeding signs, gastroenterology consultation is indicated.",
      "iron_supplementation_guidance": "For iron deficiency, iron supplementation of 100-200 mg elemental iron daily for 3-6 months may be considered to replenish stores. After hemoglobin normalization, therapy continues 3-6 additional months to restore iron depots. Ferrous formulations (sulfate, fumarate, gluconate) are preferred. For improved absorption, administration on empty stomach 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals is recommended. Concurrent intake with coffee, tea, dairy products, and calcium supplements should be avoided as they reduce iron absorption. Rich sources of highly absorbable heme iron include red meat, liver, and fish. Plant sources (non-heme iron) have lower bioavailability but absorption improves with concurrent vitamin C intake."

Elevated HOMA-IR index (4.1) indicates insulin resistance as the primary pathogenetic mechanism. Fasting hyperinsulinemia (24.5 µU/mL) reflects compensatory hypersecretion by pancreatic beta cells. Dyslipidemia (elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides) represents a typical component of metabolic syndrome and increases cardiovascular risk. Contributing risk factors include overweight status (BMI 31.2 kg/m²), family history of type 2 diabetes, and likely sedentary lifestyle.",
      "block_3_symptom_correlation": "Dry mouth and polyuria represent classic symptoms of hyperglycemia, resulting from osmotic diuresis when blood glucose exceeds renal threshold. Foot numbness may indicate early manifestations of diabetic neuropathy requiring further evaluation. Symptom complex correlates with identified carbohydrate metabolism disturbances and forms a clinical picture characteristic of decompensated type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

Microalbuminuria screening (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in first morning void) may be useful for early diabetic nephropathy detection. Dilated eye examination is recommended to exclude diabetic retinopathy; preparation includes mydriatic drops causing temporary driving impairment.

Indications for instrumental testing should be determined by a physician during in-person consultation.",

Preserved liver and kidney function (markers within normal range) excludes somatic pathology influence on thyroid status. Normal vitamin B12 and folate levels exclude megaloblastic anemia as cause of symptoms. Normal glucose metabolism markers indicate absence of glycemic disturbances.",
      "block_2_abnormalities": "Elevated TSH to 8.4 µIU/mL with normal free T4 corresponds to subclinical hypothyroidism. High anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody titer (285 IU/mL) indicates autoimmune etiology, most likely Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Mildly elevated anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (112 IU/mL) further support autoimmune process. Dyslipidemia (hypercholesterolemia) frequently accompanies hypothyroidism and may partially normalize after achieving euthyroid state. Amenorrhea for 2 months in a reproductive-age woman may relate to hypothyroidism as thyroid dysfunction affects hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Risk factors for autoimmune thyroiditis include female sex, age over 40, and genetic predisposition.",
      "block_3_symptom_correlation": "Fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, and constipation represent typical manifestations of hypothyroidism resulting from decreased basal metabolic rate and slowed metabolic processes. Amenorrhea may relate to both hypothyroidism and perimenopausal transition, requiring differential diagnosis. Symptoms correlate with identified laboratory abnormalities and form a clinical picture characteristic of autoimmune subclinical hypothyroidism.",
      "block_4_additional_tests": "Given pregnancy planning, prolactin level determination may be useful to exclude hyperprolactinemia as cause of amenorrhea. Thyroid ultrasound may be considered to evaluate gland structure and detect nodular formations. TSH receptor antibody testing may be appropriate during pregnancy planning to assess transplacental antibody transfer risk. Repeat TSH and free T4 testing after 2-3 months is recommended to confirm persistence of abnormalities. For pregnancy planning, target TSH should be less than 2.5 µIU/mL per American Thyroid Association guidelines. Indications for imaging studies should be determined by a physician during in-person consultation.",

Elevated parathyroid hormone (68 pg/mL) represents secondary hyperparathyroidism in response to vitamin D deficiency and reduced intestinal calcium absorption. Mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase may reflect increased bone turnover.
